                    I have a passion for volleyball. My journey with volleyball began in Grade 3 when I was about 8 years old. That was also the time I was diagnosed with diabetes, which was a significant challenge for me as a child. Regular hospital visits became a part of my life as I needed to closely monitor my health. My doctor advised me to avoid sweets, maintain a proper diet, and stay physically active. Hearing this, my mom encouraged me to join a local volleyball league in our town. At first, I was hesitant and nervous since I knew little about the sport, but I never expected it to have such a profound impact on my life. Volleyball became more than just a game. It turned into a form of therapy. Whenever I played, my worries and negative thoughts would disappear, replaced by a sense of happiness and fulfillment. Beyond the sport itself, what I cherish most about volleyball are the friendships I’ve built and the unforgettable memories we’ve created together, whether during intense training sessions or on the days when we were competing fiercely in a league. Volleyball taught me resilience, teamwork, and the joy of pursuing something I truly love.

                    Since I was 7 years old, I have really liked putting makeup on my face because it allows me to express my creativity in unique and artistic ways. To me, it’s like painting, with my face serving as the canvas. I find so much joy in applying makeup, experimenting with different looks, and capturing the final result to share on my social media accounts. From full-glam styles to soft, Korean-inspired aesthetics or even simple, natural looks, my makeup choices always reflect how I’m feeling in the moment. The act of applying makeup is more than just a routine. It’s my personal form of relaxation and self-care. It’s a chance for me to unwind and enjoy some ‘me time.’ I love trying out new techniques, playing with colors, and continuously improving my skills. For me, makeup isn’t solely about appearance; it’s about expressing who I am, boosting my confidence, and enjoying the endless ways I can experiment with it.

                    I absolutely love spending quality time with my family. Whether it’s watching movies together, traveling to exciting destinations, or simply enjoying each other’s company, being with the people I care about most brings me immense joy. Eating together as a complete family feels like therapy to me. It’s a time to connect, laugh, and bond. Being with my family allows me to truly be myself and fills my heart with happiness and security. Even the simplest conversations with them remind me that I am safe, loved, and free from worries. When I’m with my family, I feel like the happiest girl in the world. I treasure every moment we spend together, cherishing the memories we create, memories of laughter, adventures, and unconditional love that I’ll hold onto for a lifetime. There’s truly nothing better than sharing life’s special moments with the people who mean the most to me.
